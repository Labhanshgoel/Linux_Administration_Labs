# Lab 13 & 14

---

## Experiment Description
This lab focuses on managing file ownership and permissions in Linux using the `chown` and `chmod` commands. Tasks include changing ownership, modifying permissions, and applying special permissions.

---

## Approach

### 1. Managing File Ownership with `chown`
The `chown` command is used to change the owner and/or group of files and directories.

#### a. Changing the Owner of a File
```bash
sudo chown labhansh file.txt
```

---

#### b. Changing Both Owner and Group
```bash
sudo chown labhansh:developers file.txt
```

---

#### c. Recursive Ownership Changes
```bash
sudo chown -R labhansh:developers /home/labhansh
```

### 2. Managing File Permissions with `chmod`
The `chmod` command is used to modify file access permissions for the owner, group, and others.

#### a. Setting Permissions Using Numeric Mode (Octal)
1. Assign read, write, and execute permissions to the owner only:
   ```bash
   chmod 700 testfile.txt
   ```
   **Explanation**: Owner gets full permissions (7), group and others get none (0).

2. Assign read and write for the owner, and read-only for group and others:
   ```bash
   chmod 644 testfile.txt
   ```

---

#### b. Setting Permissions Using Symbolic Mode
1. Add execute permission for the owner:
   ```bash
   chmod u+x testfile.txt
   ```

2. Remove write permission for the group:
   ```bash
   chmod g-w testfile.txt
   ```

3. Add read permission for others:
   ```bash
   chmod o+r testfile.txt
   ```
